There are a couple things to note with this project:

1. If you choose to modify the code, you must enter your own emails and password to your email in order to send the picture propertly

2. Also, you must use GPIO 4 on the raspberry pi, as this project is configured with using that port

3. You must have a raspberry pi camera that plugs into a camera slot, as this project is not configured for usb cameras

Thank you and enjoy!
